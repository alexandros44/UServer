## ðŸŽ¯ Description

In this subfolder are all the different type of tests that have been used to make sure the package runs smoothly. The tests are made with the help of `unittest2`. They are runned on a local computer, not on a microcontroller like `esp32|8266`.

As metioned above the test will continue to grow as the application gets larger.

## ðŸ“¦ Setup

### Step 1

In order to run the test you will have to download one python package. This package is called `unittest` and can be downloaded with the next command,
```python
> pip install unittest2
```

### Step 2

Because of the fact that we are running the tests on our local computer you need to replcae the `UServer` file with the `UServerTests` one. More clearly,

##### Windows
```
..\tests> move LocalTestFiles\UServerTests.py ..\src\UServer.py
```

##### Linux
```
..\tests> mv LocalTestFiles/UServerTests.py ../src/UServer.py
```

This will override the hole file. Make sure you have a copy of `UServer`.
